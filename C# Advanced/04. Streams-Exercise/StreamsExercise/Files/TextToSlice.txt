In December 2014, Noah became a recurring contributor on The Daily Show.[33] On 30 March 2015, Comedy Central announced that Noah would succeed Jon Stewart as host of The Daily Show; his tenure began on 28 September 2015.[17] Within hours after announced as Stewart's successor, attention was drawn on the Internet to jokes that Noah had posted on his Twitter account, some of which were criticised as being offensive to women,[34][35] and others as anti-Semitic or to be making fun of the Holocaust.[36] Noah responded by tweeting, "To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian."[37] Comedy Central stood behind Noah, saying in a statement, "Like many comedians, Trevor Noah pushes boundaries; he is provocative and spares no one, himself included... To judge him or his comedy based on a handful of jokes is unfair. Trevor is a talented comedian with a bright future at Comedy Central."[38] Mary Kluk, chairperson of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD), said that the jokes were not signs of anti-Jewish prejudice and that they were part of Noah's style of comedy.[39] Noah's debut received positive reviews.[40] James Poniewozik of The New York Times praised Noah and the show's writers saying, "Mr. Noah's debut was largely successful, it was also because of the operating system - the show's writing - running under the surface".[41] Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times described Noah as "Charming and composed - almost inevitably low-key compared with the habitually antic and astonished Stewart."[42] Noah's success on the show has led to three stand-up specials on Comedy Central and Netflix.[43][44][45] On 14 September 2017, it was announced that Comedy Central had extended Noah's contract as host of The Daily Show for five years, through 2022. He will also produce and host annual end-of-year specials for Comedy Central.[46]

In April 2017, it was announced that Noah was developing a talk-show for Jordan Klepper.[47] On July 2017, the show's title was revealed to be The Opposition with Jordan Klepper and premiered on 25 September 2017.[48] On 15 June 2018, Comedy Central announced that it was canceling the show after one season, but that Klepper would be hosting a new primetime weekly docuseries, Klepper.[49] The series will premiere on 9 May 2019.[50]

In February 2018, it was announced that Noah will be executive producing a show with Roy Wood Jr. titled Jefferson County: Probation.[51][52] In March 2018, Noah signed a multiyear contract with Viacom that gives first-look rights to any future projects by Noah, be they television, feature films or shortform video content. In addition to the deal, Noah will also be launching an international production and distribution company called Day Zero Productions.[53]

Books
In January 2016, it was announced that Noah signed a book deal with Spiegel & Grau.[54] His book, Born a Crime, was published on 15 November 2016 and was received favorably by major U.S. book reviewers.[4][5][6] It became a #1 New York Times Bestseller and was named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times, Newsday, Esquire, NPR, and Booklist.[7] It was announced that a film adaptation based on the book will star Lupita Nyong'o as Trevor's mother Patricia. She will also serve as the film's co-producer alongside Noah.[55]

In February 2018, it was announced that Noah would write a second book.[56] In 2018, Noah and The Daily Show writing staff would release The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library, a book comprising hundreds of Trump tweets and featuring a foreword by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham.[57]

Other work
In 2017, he made an appearance on Nashville.[58] In 2018, he also made appearances in Black Panther and American Vandal.[59][60]

Influences
Noah has said of his comedic influences, "The kings are indisputable. Richard Pryor, [Bill] Cosby; for me personally I didn't know of him before I started comedy but Eddie Murphy changed my view on the thing and I definitely look up to him as a comedic influence. Chris Rock in terms of the modern black comedian and Dave Chappelle. Those are the guys that have laid the foundation and have moved the yardstick for all comedians, not just Black comedians."[61] He also cited Jon Stewart as an influence and a mentor, following his appointment to succeed Stewart as host of The Daily Show.[62] In an interview with The New York Times, Noah likened Stewart to "a Jewish Yoda" and recounted advice Stewart gave him, saying, "The most amazing thing that Jon did was he didn’t give me a mandate. He didn’t say, 'You need to make my show.' He specifically said: 'Make your show. Make your best version of it.' I apply those teachings of Jon’s to everything that I’m doing."[63]

Among comedians who say they were influenced by Noah are Michelle Wolf and Jordan Klepper.[64][65] Noah's mixed-race ancestry, his experiences growing up in Soweto, and his observations about race and ethnicity are leading themes in his comedy.[66][67]

Personal life
Noah is a polyglot; he speaks English, Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho, Tswana, Tsonga, Afrikaans, and German.[17][68]

In 1992 Noah's mother Patricia Nombuyiselo was married to Ngisaveni Abel Shingange, and they had two sons together, Andrew and Isaac. Trevor and his mother were both physically abused by Shingange, and the couple legally divorced in 1996.[69] In 2009, after she married Sfiso Khoza, Shingange shot her in the leg and through the back of the head; she survived as the bullet went through the base of her head, avoiding the spinal cord, brain, and all major nerves and blood vessels, then exiting with minor damage to her nostril. When Noah confronted him over the phone about the shooting, Shingange threatened his life, prompting Noah to leave Johannesburg for Los Angeles.[25][70][71] In 2011, Shingange was convicted of attempted murder, and sentenced the following year to three years of correctional supervision.[72] Noah stated that he hoped the attention surrounding the incident would raise awareness of the broader issue of domestic violence in South Africa: "For years my mother reached out to police for help with domestic abuse, and nothing was ever done. This is the norm in South Africa. Dockets went missing and cases never went to court."[25]

Noah has described himself as being progressive and having a global perspective.[73] However, he has clarified that he considers himself a "progressive person", but not a "political progressive" and prefers not to be categorized as being either right or left in the context of US partisanship.[74][75]
